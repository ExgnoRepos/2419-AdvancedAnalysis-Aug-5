# Class Introduction

## Class Logistics

- Class is from 9am to 5pm Eastern Time
- Class sessions are August 5–8
- There is a one-hour lunch from 12 to 1
- The lunch hour is sacrosanct, this gives you time to schedule non-class activities like phone meetings etc.
- There will be a 15-minute break roughly mid-morning and another roughly mid-afternoon

## Pre-tests and Post-tests

- The IRS requires that you complete a pre-test before the class begins and a post-test at the end of the class.
- The tests are anonymous—there is no way to identify what tests are yours
- The reported scores will be the average score of the class as a whole
- The instructor will provide the URL for the tests

1. You will have 10 minutes to complete the test
2. You may not consult any reference materials or look up the answers online.
3. You may not consult anyone else—the test measures what is currently in your brain.
4. **Do not guess!** If you don't know the answer, select the "Do not know" option. Good guessers can skew the results, so they are less accurate.


## Class Materials

- Materials for the class are in the [class repository](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2419-AdvancedAnalysis-Aug-5)
- All materials are in the repository and are available until September 8, 2024.

## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Main points to cover

- The name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Your current tasking – how the class materials interact with your responsibilities 
- Experience in related modeling areas
- Expectations for the class
- And to humanize things a little: one non-technical thing about you like a hobby or interest you enjoy.


## Class Protocols

- Please feel free to ask questions at any time. If you wait, you may forget details about what you wanted to ask.
- If you know that you will be absent or late, please advise me in advance, so I don't hold up the class waiting for you.
- At various points, I will go through the class list and ask you for feedback on how you are doing and how well you are understanding the material. Take this opportunity to identify any content you need me to explain further or go over again.
